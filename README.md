Signal registration service
===========================

This is a multi-provider phone number verification service for use with Signal.

When Signal users first create an account, they do so by associating that account with a phone number. Signal verifies that users actually control that phone number by sending a verification code to that number via SMS or via a phone call. This service manages the process of sending verification codes and checking codes provided by clients.

Major components
----------------

External callers interact with this service by sending [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) requests. The gRPC interface is defined in [`registration_service.proto`](./src/main/proto/registration_service.proto). gRPC requests are handled by [`RegistrationServiceGrpcEndpoint`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/rpc/RegistrationServiceGrpcEndpoint.java), which sanitizes client input and dispatches requests to [`RegistrationService`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/RegistrationService.java), which orchestrates the major business logic for the entire service.

`RegistrationService` uses a [`SenderSelectionStrategy`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/sender/SenderSelectionStrategy.java) to choose a concrete [`VerificationCodeSender`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/sender/VerificationCodeSender.java) implementation to send a verification code to a client. `VerificationCodeSenders` are responsible for sending verification codes via a specific transport (i.e. SMS or voice) and service provider and later for verifying codes provided by clients. A [`SessionRepository`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/session/SessionRepository.java) stores session data (i.e. verification codes or references to external verification sessions) for `VerificationCodeSenders`.

Configuration
-------------

At a minimum, the registration service needs at least one `VerificationCodeSender`, a `SenderSelectionStrategy`, and a `SessionRepository`. No beans of those types will be instantiated unless they're configured, and so some configuration properties must be provided. The following table describes the currently-supported (and required, in production environments) configuration properties.

Running in development mode
---------------------------

For local testing, this service can be run in the `dev` [Micronaut environment](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#environments). In the `dev` environment, the following components are provided (assuming no others of have been configured):

- A trivial verification code sender that always uses the last six digits of a phone number as a verification code
- A trivial sender selection strategy that always chooses the last-six-digits "sender"
- An in-memory session store

These components are, obviously, not suitable for production use and are intended only to facilitate local development and testing.

To run the registration service locally with the `dev` environment enabled:

```shell
./mvnw mn:run -Dmicronaut.environments=dev
```

Testing with command-line tools
-------------------------------

The registration service include a set of CLI tools to facilitate testing and development. The tools allow operators to create and inspect registration sessions, send verification codes, and check verification codes.

To build the CLI tools:

```shell
./mvnw clean package
```

To run the tool and get an exhaustive list of subcommands and flags:

```shell
java -cp target/registration-service-0.1.jar org.signal.registration.cli.RegistrationClient
```

…which yields (at the time of writing):

```
Usage: <main class> [--api-key=<apiKey>] [--host=<host>] [--port=<port>]
                    [[--plaintext] |
                    --trusted-server-certificate=<trustedServerCertificate>]
                    [COMMAND]
      --api-key=<apiKey>   API key for this call
      --host=<host>        Registration service hostname (default: localhost)
      --plaintext          Use plaintext instead of TLS? (default: false)
      --port=<port>        Registration service port (default: 50051)
      --trusted-server-certificate=<trustedServerCertificate>
                           Path to a trusted server certificate; signal.org
                           certificate trusted by default
Commands:
  create-session, create          Start a new registration session
  get-session, get                Describe an existing registration session
  send-verification-code, send    Send a verification code to a phone number
                                  associated with a session
  check-verification-code, check  Check a verification code for a registration
                                  session
```

As a concrete example of interacting with a local registration service running on port 50051, callers may create a registration session with the following command:

```shell
java -cp target/registration-service-0.1.jar org.signal.registration.cli.RegistrationClient \
  --host=localhost \
  --port=50051 \
  --plaintext \
  create-session +18005550123
```

…which yields (in this example):

```
Created registration session 2a3d2a2a41ff41fb9ce41687ddcc51a4
```

To send an SMS verification code for that session:

```shell
java -cp target/registration-service-0.1.jar org.signal.registration.cli.RegistrationClient \
  --host=localhost \
  --port=50051 \
  --plaintext \
  send-verification-code 2a3d2a2a41ff41fb9ce41687ddcc51a4
```

…and, finally, to submit a verification code for that session:

```shell
java -cp target/registration-service-0.1.jar org.signal.registration.cli.RegistrationClient \
  --host=localhost \
  --port=50051 \
  --plaintext \
  check-verification-code 2a3d2a2a41ff41fb9ce41687ddcc51a4 550123
```
